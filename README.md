Get That LatLng
===============

# Why? #


I've build a number of 'store locators' and have never gotten around to building the latitude and longitude detection into the control panels. This little project had the simple goal of using Google's geocoder to try to find it for me. If it finds the Lat and Lng, it will display it in a div tag, but eventually it would be part of a dataset going to a database.
